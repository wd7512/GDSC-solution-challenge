### Step 3: UN Sustainable Development Goals
- 3 - good health and wellbeing
- 10 - reduced inequalities

### Step 4: Identify a solution

Our solution to reduce inequality in the NHS is an accessible application making use of non-verbal communication for describing symptoms. It is targeted towards people who struggle to communicate with NHS staff such as people who do not speak English natively or people with learning disabilities. This can lead to delayed or mistreatment of certain demographics and we aim to combat this.
