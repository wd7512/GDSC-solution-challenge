## Problem Statement
Within national and local health services, there exist substanital challenges related to inequality in accessing healthcare. Patient-doctor communication is the root of healthcare, meaning it is essential the methods of communication used are as accessible for all. Traditional communication methods may be inaccessible or intimidating for certain demographic groups, leading to disparities in healthcare outcomes. This issue affects a broad spectrum of the population, particularly those with language or literacy barriers. For example, in the UK, the ONS 2011 Census revealed that ["People who cannot speak English well are more likely to be in poor health".](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/language/articles/peoplewhocannotspeakenglishwellaremorelikelytobeinpoorhealth/2015-07-09) As a result, this can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed treatement.

## Solution: Symplify
Symplify is a web and mobile application that aims to reducing inequalities in access to healthcare by making patient-doctor communication more accessible. The application removes the need for verbal patients to view images of potential symptoms they may have and add them to a list of "All Symptoms".

aims to resolve the challenges present in patient-doctor communication and thus reducing inequalities in accessing healthcare.


### Motivation
Being first generation and second generation immigrants, we understand first-hand the difficulties surrounding communication and accurately articulating the thoughts we or our family members have to others. Putting this in a healthcare context, we know the NHS in the UK are under immense pressure and would like to design a solution that can help alleviate that strain. Combining these factors, we decided to design a solution to resolve difficulties within patient-doctor communication. 

### Chosen UN Sustainable Development Goals
Goal 3: Good health and Wellbeing  
Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities   

Our solution is a web application to reduce inequality in the NHS by developing an accessible application for describing symptoms. It is targeted towards people who struggle to communicate with NHS staff such as people who do not speak English natively or people with learning disabilities. This can lead to delayed or mistreatment of certain demographics and we aim to combat this.
